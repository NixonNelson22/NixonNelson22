### Summary
# Hi 
I am an aspiring game developer, and a robotics enthusiast 
I love tinkering with my load of microcontrollers :)
and I love Gaming 
I do a lot of code in python and C# but I have knowledge of other proggramming laguages as well
I Run Arch btw! but use it to tinker with my setup a lot 
linux distros are like a never ending tinkering project  and i love tuning things making shortcuts 
and making my life easier as I do which ends up happening very rarely
